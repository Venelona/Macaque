-----Macaque-----


This is the ghost/ukagaka of Macaque, based on  TV series Lego Monkie Kid. WARNING - this thing includes headcanons and subpar writing that might be seen as OOC to some people. Macaque likes to be annoying, but a whole he'll mostly spend his time chilling on our desktop.
Made in one week for Ukagaka Dream Team Ghost Jam 2023, he doesn't include much dialogue or interactions, but still very pettable.

Macaque can do most standard Ghost functions, such as...

-emptying your recycle bin
-checking if you have new email (if you set your POP settings properly)
-setting an image as your desktop wallpaper

and he will also say random bits of dialogue as he loafs around your computer, though you can change the frequency of that in his config menu if you want him to talk more or less. WARNING - includes spoilers for Lego Monkie Kid (4 seasons).

You can talk to Macaque and ask about how his day was every time you boot him up.

You can pet his head via stroking the top of his head with your mouse cursor. Don't be surprised if he gets surprised or embarrassed about it, though.

The longer you know him and more you talk to him, the more he will grow to know you. As the time goes on, he may start to say new things, and, depending on what he reveals, give more answers to questions. Made in 7 days, it only includes a couple of things so far, and to be updated in the future. You can check on his mood through the stat screen in the menu, and you can also reset him if you want to undo what he knows of you.

Be warned that some things can't be completely erased though...
